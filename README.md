# POSTMAN-API-Testing
# Manual API Testing using Postman

This repo contains my practice work for learning API testing manually using Postman.

## Tools Used
- Node.js
- JSON Server
- Postman
- Chai Assertion
- JSONPath

## What I Practiced
- Created mock APIs using JSON Server (`employee.json`)
- Used Postman to test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Validated:
  - Status code
  - Headers, cookies, response time
  - Response body, JSON fields
  - JSON Schema
- Wrote post-response test scripts using Chai (normal and arrow functions)
- Used JSONPath to check specific values

## Files
- `employee.json` – Mock API data
- `Employee data.postman_collection` – All Postman requests
- `PostMan-Post Response vadliation scripts` – Test scripts and notes

This is a basic summary of my Postman API testing learning.
